A style guide, also known as a brand style guide or brand guidelines, is a set of standards for the design and creation of marketing materials to ensure consistent branding across all channels. It includes specific instructions on how to use a company's logo, color palette, typography, and other design elements. Creating a style guide helps maintain a cohesive brand identity, making it easier for your audience to recognize and connect with your brand. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to create a style guide for marketing materials:
    Company background and mission statement: Begin by including an overview of your company's background, mission statement, and core values. This will help set the tone for the rest of the style guide and provide context for the design choices.
    Logo: a. Provide clear guidelines on how to use your company's logo, including its primary and secondary versions (if applicable), as well as any variations for different backgrounds or formats. b. Specify the minimum and maximum size of the logo and provide instructions on maintaining the aspect ratio when resizing. c. Establish a clear space or margin around the logo that must be kept free of other design elements to ensure the logo's visibility and prominence. d. Specify any restrictions or limitations on how the logo should not be used, such as altering its colors, stretching or distorting it, or placing it on busy backgrounds.
    Color palette: a. Define your brand's primary and secondary color palette, including specific color codes (e.g., Pantone, CMYK, RGB, and HEX values) for accurate reproduction in both print and digital formats. b. Provide guidelines on when and how to use each color, as well as any restrictions or limitations on color usage. c. Include examples of color combinations and proportions that work well together to create a harmonious and cohesive visual identity.
    Typography: a. Identify the primary and secondary typefaces to be used for headings, subheadings, body text, and other typographic elements. b. Specify font sizes, weights, line spacing, and letter spacing for different levels of hierarchy in your marketing materials. c. Provide guidance on appropriate font usage in various contexts, such as print, digital, or large-format applications. d. If necessary, include guidelines for using alternative or fallback fonts when the primary typefaces are unavailable.
    Imagery and graphics: a. Define the style of photography, illustrations, and other visual elements that align with your brand's personality and messaging. b. Provide guidance on image selection, composition, and subject matter, as well as any filters or editing techniques that should be applied consistently across your marketing materials. c. Include guidelines for using icons, infographics, or other graphic elements in a consistent manner that complements your brand identity.
    Layout and composition: a. Establish guidelines for the layout and composition of various marketing materials, such as brochures, social media graphics, and web pages. b. Provide templates or grid systems to help maintain consistency in spacing, alignment, and the arrangement of design elements. c. Define rules for the use of white space and the balance between text and visual elements.
    Voice and tone: a. Outline the desired voice and tone for your written content, keeping in mind your target audience and brand personality. b. Provide examples of appropriate language, phrasing, and writing style for various marketing materials, such as website copy, social media posts, and email newsletters.
    Additional branding elements: If your brand includes other unique elements, such as patterns, textures, or custom illustrations, provide guidelines on their usage and integration into marketing materials.
    Style guide maintenance and updates: Specify how often the style guide shouldbe reviewed and updated to ensure it remains current and relevant. Assign a person or team responsible for maintaining the style guide and addressing any questions or concerns regarding its application.
    Examples and best practices:
    a. Include real-life examples of marketing materials that adhere to the style guide to demonstrate best practices and provide a visual reference for your team.
    b. Consider showcasing both good and bad examples to clarify common mistakes and reinforce proper usage of your brand's visual and written elements.
    Distribution and accessibility:
    a. Make your style guide easily accessible to your team, whether it's a printed booklet, a PDF file, or an online resource.
    b. Encourage your team members to familiarize themselves with the style guide and refer to it when creating marketing materials to ensure brand consistency across all channels.
By following these steps to create a comprehensive style guide, you'll help maintain a consistent brand identity across all your marketing materials. This will not only improve the overall aesthetic of your materials but also strengthen your brand's recognition and credibility in the eyes of your target audience.","Peace Ambassador Leadership Program (PALP) ,PALS: Peace Ambassador Leadership Summit,Peace Ambassador Leadership Summit (PALS),PALS - Peace Ambassador Leadership Summit  - Marketing Plan,Admin: All NVEEE Programs,All NVEEE Programs,PALS Peace Ambassador Leadership Summit (PALS) ",,,,

    Establish a color scheme:
    Choose a color scheme that aligns with the brand identity and is visually appealing. Use a limited number of colors (2-4) to create consistency and avoid visual clutter.

    Understand PALS' goals and objectives: Begin by familiarizing yourself with the specific goals and objectives of the PALS program, including its focus on leadership, communication, and college preparation. This understanding will help you tailor the evaluation criteria to the unique needs and expectations of the program.
    Identify key areas of expertise: Determine the specific areas of expertise that are most relevant to PALS, such as leadership development, public speaking, conflict resolution, college application strategies, essay writing, and mentorship. These areas should form the basis for evaluating the speaker's subject matter expertise.
    Consider audience needs: Think about the needs and interests of the PALS participants, as well as any challenges or concerns they may face during their college preparation journey. The evaluation criteria should reflect the ability of the speaker to address these needs and connect with the target audience.
    Establish evaluation categories: Based on the above factors, create distinct categories to evaluate potential speakers. Some suggested categories include: a. Subject matter expertise: Assess the depth of the speaker's knowledge in their respective field and their ability to present complex information in an engaging and understandable manner. b. Professional experience: Evaluate the speaker's professional background, including work in education, leadership, youth development, or related fields. c. Presentation skills: Gauge the speaker's ability to deliver an engaging, informative, and inspiring presentation. d. Compatibility with PALS' goals and values: Determine how well the speaker's expertise and message align with the objectives and values of the PALS program. e. Audience connection: Assess the speaker's ability to connect with and inspire the target audience, specifically teenagers aged 14-19. f. Availability: Consider the speaker's schedule and availability to participate in the PALS event. g. Diversity and representation: Aim to include speakers from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, representing different industries, experiences, and viewpoints.
    Develop a rating system: Create a rating system to evaluate potential speakers in each category. This can be a simple scale (e.g., 1-5) or a more comprehensive scoring system, depending on your preference.
    Weight the categories: Assign a weight or importance to each category based on its relevance to PALS' goals and objectives. For example, subject matter expertise and compatibility with PALS' values may be weighted more heavily than other categories.
    Test the evaluation criteria: Apply the evaluation criteria to a few potential speakers to ensure that the criteria effectively differentiate between strong and weak candidates. Adjust the criteria or weighting as necessary based on the results of this testing process.

So we need to be sure they dont have plans to reserve space so that we wont conflict with their plan.

The benefit for the registered student organization is for them to be able to offer community service hours during PALS to their participants, and also internship opportunities. 

reasons why this partnership is urgent:

https://rwc.sdes.ucf.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2023/01/Facility-Rate-Sheet.pdf

    We want to reserve multipurpose rooms in the recreation and wellness center for workshops, and it would be free for them. If we reserve it under the UCF department it would be $25 an hour.
    We want to reserve the pavilions and volleyball area at Lake Claire. If we reserve it through and RSO it would be free if we do it through our department it would be $25 an hour. If we do it through envy it would be $40 an hour.
    To reserve the leisure pool would be free for an hour or so. For a UCF department it would be $100 an hour.

Please create a spreadsheet of potential registered student organizations who may want to partner with us. Maybe you can get their information from a website. You need the phone number and email address of a Registered Agent for the group.

Contact me about this if you need more direction.",,Find students who can volunteer at UCF PALS,,,
